We’ve upgraded the feature — **online booking!** 🔥

## Benefits for the manager

1. **Fewer calls and messages** — clients book themselves via a single link (socials, messengers, business card).
2. **Flexible schedule:** set up by week + fine-tune individual days and exceptions.
3. **Only free slots are shown** — less confusion and double bookings.
4. **Analytics** — reports on bookings, capacity, revenue.
5. **Automatic review collection** — request feedback after the visit without manual outreach.
6. **Telegram reminders** — clients get automatic booking reminders.
7. **Contact and Telegram in every request** — easy to remind and get in touch.
8. **Branded booking page** — logo, colors, business name.

## Benefits for the client

1. **Booking via link** in the browser or through the Telegram bot — whichever is more convenient. Simple flow — few steps, no calls or registration.
2. **Choose service, specialist, date and time** from real available slots.
3. **Add the visit to Google or Yandex Calendar** — less chance of forgetting.
4. **Subscribe to the bot** — reminders and quick contact with the company.
5. **Mobile-friendly.**

Pretty nice, right?
