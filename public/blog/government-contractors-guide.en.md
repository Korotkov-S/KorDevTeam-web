My [Telegram channel](https://t.me/kordevteam) - about my studio, life, management, smart thoughts (hopefully), personal effectiveness, humor

## Introduction

Hello, my name is Gennady Korotkov. I run a web studio, and before that I worked in government service for 10 years, where I was involved in government procurement under Federal Law 44-FZ. Today I will share my experience and tell you how to effectively work with government contractors in the IT sector.

What is government service (Federal Law dated 27.07.2004 N 79-FZ) - this is the professional service activity of citizens of the Russian Federation to ensure the execution of powers of the Russian Federation, federal state bodies, subjects of the Russian Federation, state bodies of subjects of the Russian Federation, persons holding state positions of the Russian Federation, as well as state positions of subjects of the Russian Federation.

In simple terms, a government employee is:

- A person who works in the budget
- A person who fulfills the requirements of Russian legislation
- SERVES for the good of the homeland
- Has power
- Low salary
- Clear hierarchy
- Own interests

## 44-FZ Principles:

- Principles of openness and transparency
- Principle of ensuring competition
- Principle of customer professionalism
- Principle of stimulating innovation
- Principle of unity of the contract system in the field of procurement
- Principle of responsibility for the effectiveness of meeting state and municipal needs, efficiency of procurement

In summary, we have a person (customer) and the law.

The game rules are outlined and you need to stay within them to successfully work with a government contractor.

For successful work with government orders, I would highlight several criteria:

- Having a good lawyer
- Having a good procurement specialist for preparing documents for submitting applications
- Having expertise in the service provided and preferably, not lower than the customer's level! (no matter how funny it sounds)
- Experience working with people from government service
- Having a margin of safety

Today we will focus specifically on working with people.

## 1. Motivation of Government Employees: How to Understand and Work with It

At the start of contract work, I would first determine personality types using the DISC methodology.

DISC is a psychometric behavior classification system that helps understand and categorize different communication styles in people.

### 1. D (Dominance) — Dominance

**Characteristics:** Decisiveness, result-oriented, straightforwardness, desire for control.

**IT Specialties:**
- Project Managers: Often take responsibility, make quick decisions and lead the team to the goal.
- CTOs: Strategists who focus on achieving business goals.
- System Architects: Make key decisions about structure and development direction.

### 2. I (Influence) — Influence

**Characteristics:** Sociability, enthusiasm, people-oriented, ability to inspire.

**IT Specialties:**
- Product Managers: Often communicate with clients and team, motivate and inspire.
- Tech Evangelists: Promote new technologies, speak at conferences, inspire audiences.
- UX/UI Designers: Work with people to understand their needs and create convenient interfaces.

### 3. S (Steadiness) — Steadiness

**Characteristics:** Reliability, patience, team-oriented, conflict avoidance.

**IT Specialties:**
- QA Engineers: Thoroughly check products, work methodically and carefully.
- DevOps Engineers: Ensure stability and uninterrupted system operation.
- System Administrators: Maintain infrastructure, solve problems and ensure stability.

### 4. C (Conscientiousness) — Conscientiousness

**Characteristics:** Analytical, attention to detail, striving for accuracy, process-oriented.

**IT Specialties:**
- Developers (Backend, Data Engineers): Write code that must be accurate and efficient.
- Data Scientists: Work with large volumes of information, require high accuracy.
- Cybersecurity Specialists: Analyze risks and ensure system security.

**Important:**
Not all IT specialists strictly correspond to one type. For example, a developer can be both C (analyst) and D (if he is a team leader).
IT teams often consist of people with different DISC styles, which helps achieve balance between creativity, accuracy and speed.

### Motivation Types by Gercikov:

**1. Instrumental**

Distinctive features: expects work to bring good income first of all; strives to independently provide for his life.
Qualification level: often average.
Responsibility level: average. With monetary motivation, can be a fairly responsible performer.
Work preferences: instrumental views work exclusively as a source of income. If his work is highly paid, he will perform it well, no matter how complex it is.
Attitude to money: expects piecework salary that will depend on achieved work results.
How to motivate: of course, with money! Material motivation is possible (purchase or rental of housing, car); if there is a need to apply anti-incentives, they should also be related to money (for example, fines).

**2. Professional**

Distinctive features: striving for self-expression. Professional is ready to endlessly prove to himself and others that he is the best.
Qualification level: high, he really becomes a professional in his field.
Responsibility level: quite high. Characterized by independence.
Work preferences: creative work with the possibility of self-expression. Professional is interested in the content of the work he performs. If the work does not interest him, he will not agree to take it on for any money.
Attitude to money: payment for work, taking into account differences in qualifications.
How to motivate: public recognition as the best in his field; career growth; improvement of working conditions, payment for training and professional development.

**3. Patriot**

Distinctive features: awareness of one's indispensability; striving to participate in important company affairs.
Qualification level: average or high.
Responsibility level: patriot will take on additional responsibility if he realizes the full importance of the matter for the organization.
Work preferences: same here - he will take on any work if he has enough motivation.
Attitude to money: small monetary compensations, along with recognition of merits.
How to motivate: for patriot the main thing is public recognition (various public rewards and praise), gratitude from management; his social status.

**4. Owner**

Distinctive features: performs work with maximum dedication. Does not require constant control. Very effective type.
Qualification level: high.
Responsibility level: high; fully accepts responsibility for the work performed.
Work preferences: no special preferences in any work. However, entrepreneurial activity is more motivating.
Attitude to money: money for this type is not the most important, as the result is more important for him. Preferred form of payment - based on work results.
How to motivate: the biggest motivation for owner is participation in co-ownership and management, promoting career growth. This type does not need punishments and instructions. And too obvious manifestation of care can even offend him.

**5. Avoidant (Lumpenized)**

Distinctive features: striving to avoid unpleasant circumstances for oneself, as a rule, work is also among these circumstances.
Qualification level: below average. No desire to improve qualifications.
Responsibility level: not high; strives to shift it to someone else. Dependent on the manager. Strives to minimize efforts.
Work preferences: no special preferences. The advantage of this type is that he can be assigned such work that others are unlikely to agree to, as long as they pay the agreed amount for it.
Attitude to money: such an employee expects first of all a stable guaranteed salary (salary part). Sometimes, agrees to low pay on condition that others do not receive more.
How to motivate: show care for the employee (providing various benefits and compensations); material motivation (purchase or rental of housing, car); anti-incentives (punishments, fines).

Personality type - building tactics of negotiations, discussions, behavior, so that the customer is comfortable working with you, so that he does not experience discomfort, so that he can trust you and become your advocate in his organization.

**What does this give us?**

Motivation type - gives understanding of what can be carefully manipulated and what strings can be played. For example, with Lumpen - fears of losing a bonus, if you have identified a bunch of problems in the TOR, with professional - invite him to discussions with your team, Patriot - praise how great he is.

Together - this will give you some opportunities when executing the contract, help you get out of unpleasant situations.

## 2. Negotiations with Government Employees: Pros and Cons of Official Correspondence

### Features of Negotiations

Government employees often act within strict regulations, which limits their flexibility.

Official correspondence is a way to record agreements, but it can slow down the process.

It is important to conduct correspondence as specified in the contract, so that the court accepts it.

I advise starting official correspondence from the moment of signing the contract, to accustom the customer to this method of communication and if suddenly it becomes necessary to organize pre-trial work, you will have all the material for this.

### Cases when it is mandatory to conduct official correspondence:

- coordination of TOR decisions;
- controversial issues;
- you are not provided with documentation on time;
- invoices, acts of acceptance of completed work

### Strategies for Conducting Negotiations

- Before negotiations, study the requirements of 44-FZ, legislation, CONTRACT, to understand what point you are at and what possible solutions exist - because you need to come to the customer with a solution, not shift responsibility to him;
- Determine the opponent's personality type and build negotiation strategy from this knowledge;
- Combine official correspondence with personal meetings or calls.
- Use correspondence to record key points, not to discuss details;
- Be ready for compromises, but DO NOT always record them in writing (from your side);

The government customer is limited by law, he doesn't care that you miscalculated by 50% of the contract cost, all he needs is for the working day to end and not to be scolded.

Therefore, the ideal approach to agree is to think through a solution that complies with the law, the customer won't be scolded, he won't have problems and preferably, the customer doesn't need to do anything.

## 3. Resolving Conflicts When Working with Government Contractors

### General Tips:

You need to immediately gently show work boundaries (personal boundaries).

The manager needs to work on relationships with the customer, get to personal topics, find common ground, make friends with him.

### Types of Conflicts

- **Organizational:** mismatch of deadlines, scope of work, quality.
- **Communication:** misunderstanding, difference in expectations.
- **Legal:** interpretation of contract terms, TOR changes.
- **Personal:** did not agree on views on life.

### Conflict Resolution Strategies

Figure out in which plane the conflict lies: emotional or rational.

If you suspect a conflict situation, enter it and resolve it - if successful, this will bring you closer to the customer and prevent going to the point of no return.

- **Proactivity:** identify potential conflicts at early stages, inform the customer about this.
- **Empathy:** try to understand the customer's position and his limitations, but if it doesn't work, then you need to talk, listen and convey your picture of the world, so that synchronization occurs;
- **Compromise:** offer solutions that take into account the interests of both parties.
- **Documentation:** record all agreements to avoid repeated conflicts.

## 4. Manipulations in Work with Government Contractors

**Manipulations from the contractor side - should not be at all!**

### Manipulations from the Customer Side

- Pressure with deadlines: requirement to speed up work without changing conditions.
- Expansion of work scope: attempts to add tasks without increasing budget.
- Use of bureaucracy: delaying approvals or payments.
- Threats of enhanced work acceptance;
- Promise that there will be more work in the future, but now do it cheaper or a bit more;
- Before signing the contract, they say they found a cheaper contractor (this is if the contract is not signed through an auction);
- Customer discovers errors in TOR, and due to vague wording, tries to slip in all unimaginable work;

### How to Resist Manipulations

- If this is a legal plane, then the lawyer needs to assess the risks, possible occurrence of this event and start laying straw;
- Go to dialogue with the customer and expose the manipulation, directly ask what his goal is and what he wants;
- Be transparent: provide complete information about the progress of work.
- Record all agreements on paper: this reduces the risk of manipulations.
- Collect information about the customer, his mistakes and what can be used in negotiations as a lever of influence, if needed;
- Use arguments: rely on facts and data, not emotions.

## 5. Managing Changes in Government Contracts with Strictly Fixed TOR

### Why Changes are Difficult

- Strict requirements of 44-FZ: any change requires signing an additional agreement;
- Risk of inspections: changes can attract the attention of controlling authorities.
- 44-FZ has restrictions on making changes to government contracts - Article 95

### Change Management Strategies:

- you can change TOR only within the requirements of Article 95, or if there are additional permissions specified in the legislation;
- Prove the necessity of changes: provide arguments why changes will improve the result.
- Offer alternatives: show how the goal can be achieved without significant TOR changes.
- Use regulations: rely on 44-FZ norms that allow changes in certain cases.
- Create time and budget reserve: this will allow accounting for possible changes.

## Key Recommendations:

1. Understand the customer's motivation and personality type.
2. Strictly observe deadlines and formalities.
3. Record all agreements in writing.
4. Prepare straw for yourself.
