# "Krasotulya": why micro & small businesses need it (card #4 — email campaigns for clients)

!["Krasotulya" CRM](/krasotula4.png)

Gennadiy Korotkov here — head of KorDev Team.
Today we'll talk about problem #4 — email campaigns for clients.

This task is at the core of the "Krasotulya" service.
It's important to work with clients constantly: keep their attention, share something new and useful, notify about promotions, invite to master classes and seminars, congratulate on holidays and birthdays.
And this work should be regular.

"Krasotulya" allows you to do exactly that, saving your time that you can dedicate to more important tasks.

In addition, the service offers:

AI-generated responses if you don't know how to respond to negative feedback or simply don't have time to think through a message;

text error checking and "sales appeal" analysis.

In the future, we plan to add autoresponders — for example, for notifications outside business hours. We just need to understand which specific features you need.

We're waiting for your requests!
