# Stop Losing Negotiations! Iron-Clad Argumentation That Breaks Resistance Even from Stubborn Clients

This post was written after reading Nikita Nepryakhin's book "Argue This!" — highly recommend it, it covers argumentation in great detail.

Plus some of my own experience.

## How often do you have to convince others you're right?

I often encounter situations when developing web services and mobile applications where I need to justify to clients why certain decisions were made or convince them away from initially incorrect actions.

For example, there was a situation when we worked with a client who had their own IT department plus some layers in the form of managers.

It was impossible to work effectively in that system, tasks were passed without descriptions, the client's team constantly delayed deadlines for providing us with APIs, there was chaos and conflicts.

Everything was resolved when we had a conversation, selected arguments with a philosophy that matched the client's philosophy - money. And oh my - work started flowing.

I'm a systematic person, and I need clear templates and algorithms.

The question arises: is there a system in argumentation? How to properly build your line, prove, reflect counterarguments and attack the opponent's position? I'll tell you about this in the article.

## Why are some arguments stronger than others?

Have you ever wondered why some arguments affect you more than others?

A strong argument consists of two components:

1. **Proof** — reinforcement with examples, logic, and emotional imagery. The brighter and more detailed the example, the more convincing the argument.

2. **Depth** — a point that is close to the interlocutor's value system. For example, if a person values money, the argument should be related to financial benefit. If career is important to them — with professional growth.

Without proof, the argument is unclear; without depth, it's unimportant. Therefore, it's important to consider both criteria.

## How to be logical and persuasive?

To be logical and persuasive, you need to convey your thought to the opponent. The law in communication is that we respond as the opposite side understands us.

Algorithm for building a clear argumentation structure:

1. **Start with an announcement** — briefly indicate what will be discussed.

2. **Use demarcation when listing arguments** — divide arguments into blocks.

For example:

- First argument: narrative + example + return to thesis.

- Second argument: similar structure.

- Third argument: emotional picture + thesis.

3. **Summarize your speech** — repeat the main points (1, 2, 3) and return to the main thesis.

## Assertion Tactics

1. **Direct assertion** — this is argumentation according to the above formula, a clear and simple argumentation line. Suitable when it's important for the opponent to remember your points. Effective in the absence of direct dialogue.

2. **Seizing initiative** — anticipating counterarguments and refuting them. Used in tough negotiations, but not recommended with superiors or high-status people.

3. **Sincere position** — acknowledging some shortcomings of your point of view. Doesn't always work: an experienced opponent can use this against you.

## Denial Tactics: How to Break the Opponent's Argument

This is interesting, let's see how you can break the opponent's arguments and what the opponent can attack in our argumentation line.

Counterargumentation can be directed at:

1. **The argument itself** — if it's clearly false. Start with the phrase: "No, that's not true."

2. **Support and examples** — attack weak points in the evidence base. This creates the impression that the entire argument is broken.

3. **Philosophy** — offer a more significant value.

4. **Logic** — break the cause-and-effect connection.

Ask: "What's the connection between the thesis and the argument?"

Additional methods:

- Strike at the thesis: "This is impossible to implement."

- Unconvincing tactic: "Your arguments don't convince me."

- Reduction to absurdity — ridiculing the opponent's position.

## Iron Logic: Basic Laws

What is iron logic?

1. The thesis must be clear and unchanging.

2. Arguments must be:

- True.
- Non-contradictory.
- Supported by evidence.

3. **Cause-and-effect connection** — the thesis must logically follow from the arguments.

## How to Detect Errors in the Opponent's Logic?

Check using a simple algorithm:

- **Thesis**: Is the subject of discussion clear? Is there a substitution of the topic?

- **Arguments**: Are they true? Are they not baseless? Do they contradict each other?

- **Logic**: Is there a connection between the thesis and arguments?
