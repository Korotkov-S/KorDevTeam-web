# “Krasotulya”: why micro & small businesses need it (card #1 — scattered data)

Hello everyone!

Gennadiy Korotkov here — head of KorDev Team.

Why do micro and small businesses need the “Krasotulya” service, and what problems (as of 2026-01-20) does it solve?

I believe you should pay for a service only in one case: when it makes your processes cheaper and faster.

That’s exactly what “Krasotulya” is designed to do.

I’ll talk about the specific problems we solve every day in a short “card” format — it’s easier to read and absorb.

The idea behind “Krasotulya” is to take real pains from the beauty business world and apply modern IT solutions to them. For example, MacBook users appreciate the simplicity of Spotlight search and the dock at the bottom of the screen.

We built the same principle of simplicity and accessibility into our service.

And today’s first card is about problem #1: scattered data.
