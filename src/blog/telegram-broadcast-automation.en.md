# Telegram Broadcast Automation: Saving 16 Hours of Work for Kusidis PRO

## Introduction

Mass messaging to customers is one of the most time-consuming tasks in marketing. This is especially true for service businesses, where it's necessary to regularly inform customers about new offers, promotions, and special services. In this article, we'll share a real case study of automating mass messaging through a Telegram bot for Kusidis PRO massage salon in Vladimir, which saved 16 hours of manual work per month.

## The Problem: Manual Messaging Took Too Much Time

### Initial Situation

Kusidis PRO massage salon in Vladimir actively used Telegram for customer communication. Weekly, the administrator had to:

- **Manually copy** customer lists from the database
- **Create messages** with promotions and offers
- **Send messages** to each customer individually
- **Track** delivery and responses
- **Maintain statistics** on opens and conversions

**Time per broadcast:** 2-3 hours  
**Number of broadcasts per month:** 6-8  
**Total time per month:** 16-24 hours of employee work

### Problems with Manual Approach

1. **High labor costs** — employee spent significant time on routine work
2. **Human error** — possible mistakes when copying contacts
3. **No personalization** — everyone received the same messages
4. **Difficulty with analytics** — hard to track broadcast effectiveness
5. **Limited scalability** — as customer base grew, broadcast time increased

## Solution: Telegram Bot for Automated Broadcasting

### Solution Architecture

We developed a Telegram bot that automates the entire mass messaging process:

### Key Bot Features

#### 1. Scheduled Automatic Broadcasting

The bot allows setting up automatic message broadcasting:

- **On schedule** — daily, weekly, or on specific days
- **By segments** — broadcasting only to specific customer groups
- **Personalization** — using customer name and other data

#### 2. Audience Segmentation

The system allows dividing customers into groups:

- **New customers** — those who haven't visited the salon yet
- **Regular customers** — frequent visitors
- **Inactive customers** — those who haven't visited in a long time
- **VIP customers** — with special service conditions

#### 3. Message Personalization

Each message can be personalized:

#### 4. Analytics and Reporting

The bot automatically collects statistics:

- **Number of sent messages**
- **Percentage of delivered messages**
- **Number of opens**
- **Conversion to booking** (clicks on buttons)
- **Customer response time**

### Technical Implementation

#### Technology Stack

- **Node.js** — bot server-side
- **Telegraf** — library for working with Telegram Bot API
- **PostgreSQL** — customer database
- **Express.js** — web interface for management
- **Node-cron** — task scheduler for automatic broadcasts

#### Broadcast Code Example

#### Handling Responses and Bookings

The bot also handles customer responses:

## Implementation Results

### Time Savings

**Before automation:**
- Time per broadcast: 2-3 hours
- Number of broadcasts per month: 6-8
- **Total time: 16-24 hours per month**

**After automation:**
- Time to set up broadcast: 5-10 minutes
- Number of broadcasts per month: 6-8
- **Total time: 40-80 minutes per month**

**Savings: 16 hours of employee work per month**

### Efficiency Improvements

1. **Increased reach** — can now send broadcasts to all customers, not just part of the database
2. **Personalization** — each message adapts to the customer
3. **Analytics** — complete statistics for each broadcast
4. **Conversion** — 30% increase in bookings thanks to personalized offers
5. **Scalability** — database can grow without increasing broadcast time

### ROI (Return on Investment)

**Development costs:** 80,000 rubles  
**Monthly savings:** 16 hours × 500 rub/hour = 8,000 rubles  
**Payback period:** 10 months

**Additional benefits:**
- 30% increase in conversion = additional revenue
- Freeing up employee time for other tasks
- Improved customer service quality

## Features for Cold Sales

### Segmentation for Cold Sales

For effective cold sales, the bot uses special segmentation:

1. **New subscribers** — those who just subscribed to the bot
2. **Inactive customers** — haven't visited the salon for more than 3 months
3. **Potential customers** — submitted a request but didn't book
4. **Former customers** — visited the salon but stopped

### Cold Sales Strategy

### A/B Testing Messages

The bot supports A/B testing to optimize conversion:

## Admin Panel for Management

### Web Interface for Administrator

We created a simple admin panel where you can:

1. **Create broadcasts** — write a message and select a segment
2. **Schedule broadcasts** — set date and time for sending
3. **View statistics** — results of all broadcasts
4. **Manage segments** — create and edit customer groups
5. **Analytics** — conversion and effectiveness charts

### Interface Example

## Best Practices for Mass Broadcasting

### 1. Respecting Telegram Limits

Telegram has limits on message quantity:
- **20 messages per second** for one bot
- **30 messages per second** for a group of bots

Our bot automatically respects these limits:

### 2. Error Handling

It's important to handle errors correctly:

### 3. Personalization Without Spam

Personalization should be appropriate:

### 4. Optimal Broadcast Time

Analysis shows the best time for broadcasts:

- **Weekdays:** 10:00-12:00, 18:00-20:00
- **Weekends:** 11:00-13:00, 17:00-19:00
