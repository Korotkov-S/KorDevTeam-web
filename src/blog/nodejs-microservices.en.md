# Microservices Architecture on Node.js with NestJS

## Why Microservices?

Microservices architecture allows breaking down a monolithic application into small, independent services that are easy to scale and maintain.

## Advantages of NestJS for Microservices

NestJS provides built-in microservices support out of the box:

1. **Transports**: TCP, Redis, NATS, RabbitMQ, Kafka
2. **Decorators**: Easy work with messaging patterns
3. **Dependency Injection**: Easy dependency management

## Creating a Microservice

### 1. Install dependencies

### 2. Configure main.ts

### 3. Create a controller

## Communication Between Services

### Synchronous call

### Asynchronous events

## Best Practices

1. **API Gateway**: Use a gateway for request routing
2. **Service Discovery**: Consul or Eureka for service discovery
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Protection against cascading failures
4. **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger or Zipkin for monitoring
5. **Centralized Logging**: ELK Stack

## Monitoring and Debugging

Use Prometheus for metrics:

## Conclusion

Microservices architecture with NestJS provides powerful tools for building scalable systems. Start with small services and gradually increase their number as the project grows.
