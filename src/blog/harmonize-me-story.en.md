# "HarmonizeMe I broke down again..." — Daria knows why this happens and will teach you how to avoid breakdowns

## Service Story

We helped Daria Kuznetsova, an expert in nutrition psychology, create a platform that breaks patterns in the fight against excess weight.

HarmonizeMe helps work not with the plate, but with experiences. Because behind overeating often lies not weakness, but an unheard emotion. HarmonizeMe is like an exhale among endless "must" and "pull yourself together". Here you can stop being a strict boss to your body and become its ally for the first time.

## Service Story

When psychologist Daria Kuznetsova faced the fact that diets don't work, she created HarmonizeMe — a platform that changes not calories, but thinking.

This is not another "-5 kg per week" marathon. This is a path to conscious relationships with body and food — without guilt, without prohibitions, without shame. When emotions come into play — anxiety, loneliness, anger, resentment — fighting them with diets is useless.

## Not another diet, but a mindset reboot

HarmonizeMe is a game-based approach to eating behavior psychology. No prohibitions and guilt — only conscious changes through:

✅ **Courses** — 1 free, 3 paid and a collection of 40 lessons (with the ability to add new ones and translate into other languages).

✅ **AI Assistant** — trained on Daria's book, helps analyze "food breakdowns", supports in difficult moments and gives personalized advice.

✅ **Motivation** — earn points for completing lessons and exchange them for useful materials from books to additional courses.

✅ **Materials** — notes, checklists and articles to consolidate results.

## Technical Side

▸ **Stack:** Next.js, Adonis.js, PostgreSQL

▸ **Customized AI** based on author's methodology

▸ **Admin panel** for content management

▸ **Built-in marketplace** for motivational products

## Feature

This is not just courses — it's a system that adapts to you.

Want strict control? AI will gather you. Need soft support? Courses will guide without stress.

The project's mission is to make people happier in their bodies, without pain, shame and the eternal race for the ideal.

For this reason, the platform consciously keeps prices affordable. Psychological support should be a norm, not a luxury.

## For Whom

For those who are tired of "hold on, it's just willpower". Here — psychology, technology and real tools for change.
